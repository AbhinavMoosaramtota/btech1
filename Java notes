static keyword in main helps in running the program without object.
naming conventions: in camelScaleConvention the first letter of the first word is small.
PascalConvention has capital camelScaleConvention is used in functions for classes we use pascal scale convention.

primitive data type:int, float are few primitive data types.
non-primitive data type:they are derived form primitive data type

public static void main (String args[]) (it is the main function from where the java program execution starts) here 
public: This keyword means that the method is accessible anywhere, including from outside the class it's declared in. 
static: By using 'static', we're saying that the main method can be run without needing an instance of the class. 
void: This keyword indicates that the main method doesn't return any value.String args[]: 
The main() method also accepts some data from the user. It accepts a group of strings, which is called a string array.

when we are scanning we use sc.nextInt it is the method to read from the keyboard in this case it is an integer type.
if you want to use the scanner function then we need to use the header file import.java.util.scanner

Types of Operators:
Arithmetic Operator: +,-,*,/,%
Assignment Operator: =, +=
Comparision Operator: ==,>=,<=
Logical Operator: &&,||,!
Bitwise Operator: &
Arithemetic operators cannot work with booleans
Precedence tells us which symbol to execute first and Associativity tells us the directrion of execution if they have same 
precedence

Strings:
a string is a sequence of characters
String name;
name = new String ("abhi");
trimstring keyword is used to remove all the spaces present in the doublequotes
